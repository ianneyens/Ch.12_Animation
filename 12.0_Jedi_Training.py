All questions are about the final code in Chapter 12:

1.) Where is the ball's original location?
320,240
2.) What are the variables dx and dy?
how many pixels the ball will move
3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?
180
4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?
-120
5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?
on_update, on_draw
6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
changes x velocity when the ball gets to the edge
7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy
actually changes where the y value is
8.) What is the width of the window?
640
9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
checking to see if the ball is at the top or bottom of the screen
10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
checking to see if the ball is on the left or right of the screen
